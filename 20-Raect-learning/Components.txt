JSX makes it easier to write & add HTML in React.


*** JSX Rules ***
* JSX must return a single parent Element.
* JSX elements must be properly closed.
* JSX attribute are writen using camelCase.

*** Expression in JSX ***
With JSX you can write Expression inside curly braces. The Expression can be a React variable , or properly, or any other valid "JavaScript Expression". JSX will execute the Expression and return  the result . {4 + 4} = 8

*** Lists ***
In React, you will render lists with some type of loop. The JavaScript map() array method is generally the prefered method.
