** Use Reducer **

useReducer is a hook that is similar to useState , but it is designed for "more complex" state objects or state transitions that ivolves multiple sub-values. It allows you to manage state in a functional, Immatuable way.


 const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
   

   state : The Current state  Value
   dispatch : A function you call to send actions to the reducer
   reducer : This is a function that describes how the state should change based on actions.
